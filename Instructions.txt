The instructions to use are common for both End-user and Developer version.
Only difference is that for developer version you need to have Python installed along with PyPDF2 module.

How to use:

Step 1: Create a folder and add all the pdf files that you want to merge in that folder.
Step 2: Copy this pdfMerger.exe/pdefMerger.py file into that folder.
Step 3: pdfMerger merges files in alphabetic order of their names.
For example: Four pdf files named: Airline, 7rules, Train and bus will be merged in the following order
7rules, Airline, bus, Train
Step 4: If needed, rename file names to match the order in which they need to be merged.
Step 5: Double-click the pdfMerger.exe/pdfMerger.py file, a command window shall open.
Step 6: Enter a name for the final merged pdf when asked.
Step 7: Make sure no file with the same name already exists in the current folder.
Step: Close the command prompt before opening the mergedPDF.

NOTE: Non-PDF files that are present in the folder will simply be ignored. 
NOTE: If you enter a name for the final merged pdf that already exists the folder, then the program will ask you to retry with some other name.
NOTE: If the merged PDF fails to open, make sure you have closed the command prompt.
